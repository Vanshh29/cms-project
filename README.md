Displays a paginated list of words/phrases from a local SQLite database.
Each entry shows the word/phrase, translation, and example sentence (if available).
Edit & Update
Clicking an “Edit” button enables inline editing of:
Word/Phrase
Translation
Example sentence
Changes are saved back to the SQLite database.
Search & Filter
A search bar filters results by a keyword in the word/phrase, translation, or example sentence.
Load Initial Data
At startup, the application (or a script) fetches JSON from:
sm1_new_kap1.json
Inserts the records into the local database automatically.
Tech Stack

Backend: Node.js & Express.js
Database: SQLite (local words.db file)
Frontend: React (Create React App)
HTTP Client: Axios (for fetching JSON and communicating with the server)

Installation & Setup

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd cms-project
2. Server Setup
Install dependencies:
cd server
npm install
(Optional) Clear old DB if you have one you want to reset:
rm words.db
This step ensures you start fresh if your schema has changed.
Load initial data:
node scripts/loadData.js
This fetches the JSON file and inserts it into the newly created words.db.

If successful, you’ll see Data loaded successfully. in the terminal.
If you see an error like no column named wordFirstLang, check that your DB columns match what you’re inserting.
Start the server:
npm start
By default, the server runs on http://localhost:3001.
3. Client Setup
Open a new terminal (still in the project root):

cd client
npm install
npm start
The React app will launch at http://localhost:3000.
Usage

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
View the words/phrases in a paginated table.
Search by typing in the search bar (filters by any matching text).
Edit a row:
Click Edit.
Update fields (word, translation, example sentence).
Click Save to write changes to the SQLite database.
How It Works

Database (SQLite)
A words table is created (or updated) in db.js.
Each record contains:
id (primary key, integer)
word (text)
translation (text)
example_sentence (text, optional)
Data Loading Script
The file scripts/loadData.js fetches JSON from the specified URL.
It inserts each object from the JSON into the words table via SQLite.
Run this script whenever you need to refresh or reload your data.
Server (Express)
Routes in routes/words.js:
GET /api/words: Returns paginated & searchable data.
PUT /api/words/:id: Updates the word, translation, or example sentence by ID.
Pagination & Search:
Query params like ?page=1&limit=10&search=hello handled by SQL LIMIT, OFFSET, and LIKE.
Client (React)
App.js handles:
Fetching data (GET /api/words)
Pagination logic
Search input & state
WordTable.js:
Renders rows, each with Edit and Save buttons.
Provides inline editing for word, translation, example sentence.
Calls onUpdate(id, newFields) to send a PUT request via api.js.
